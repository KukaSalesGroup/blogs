## Lists
We can continue to type paragraphs after an image has been linked. We can link other images if we please, but I think the point has been made. Lists can be easily created by starting lines with the tack symbol (-). An example of this can be seen at the top of the document.

## Anchors
Anchors are useful ways for a user to quickly navigate though a blog post. The anchors for this page can be seen at the top of this document. Anchors are not tools to link to other blog posts.
