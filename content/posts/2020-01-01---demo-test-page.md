## Subtitle
Starting a new line with two number symbols (#) creates a subtitle for a paragraph.

## Anchors
Anchors are useful ways for a user to quickly navigate though a blog post. The anchors for this page can be seen at the top of this document. Anchors are not tools to link to other blog posts.

## Creating Paragraph
Here is the location you will paste articles that have been previously written. If you would like arrange an image on the page follow the format below. 

## Display Image
![Text here is adiscription of the image being linked. The image linked must also be linked in the socialImage section](/media/image-2.jpg)

## Lists
We can continue to type paragraphs after an image has been linked. We can link other images if we please, but I think the point has been made. Lists can be easily created by starting lines with the tack symbol (-).
