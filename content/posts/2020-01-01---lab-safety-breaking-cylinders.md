With most break machines out there today, the load rate is still manually controlled. For this reason, it is vital that you have a technician standing near the machine to monitor the rate. This does, however, make them susceptible to debris coming from the cylinder as it breaks. There are a few simple steps to take that will ensure the safety of the technician.

The first is make sure they are in the habit of **closing the metal door** after they have loaded the cylinder. That door is there to protect against large debris that may come off of a high strength cylinder (namely, 6”X12”).

The second thing you can do is require **safety glasses** for anyone breaking cylinders. I know it sounds overly simple, but some people do not enforce this rule, and I think it is vital to the safety of the technician.

The last thing you can do to protect against debris is **have a proper wrap to cover the breaking cylinder** with. Canvas of some sort is a good material to use for this, as it is softer and will absorb more force.

I have seen people use an old cylinder mold shell for this purpose. I strongly disagree with this. I have seen a cylinder break with enough force to break the mold being used, resulting in even more dangerous debris.  Additionally, when the plastic breaks it tends to be sharper, and it is lighter, so it can travel much faster.

**In summary:** close the metal door, wear safty glasses, and properly wrap the cylinder. Buying a canvas wrap may seem like a silly expense but it is a much better alternative than an injured employee.
